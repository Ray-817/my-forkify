# JavaScript Project – [Udemy: The Complete JavaScript Course 2024](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe/)
[Live Demo on Netlify](https://myforkify-rayjiang.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview
This is a hands-on JavaScript project I built while taking Jonas Schmedtmann’s Complete JavaScript Course. The project is part of a guided curriculum designed to teach core JavaScript concepts by building interactive real-world applications.
In this project, I implemented all the functionality using vanilla JavaScript, focusing on clean code structure, separation of concerns, and user interaction through the DOM.

## What I Learnd
During this project, I made a conscious effort to:
1. Understand fundamental grammer of JavaScript
2. Use ES6+ features such as const, let, arrow functions, and template literals
3. Practice DOM manipulation and event-driven programming
4. Have a deep understanding of how Asynchronous JavaScript works
6. Structure the css code by using Sass to create a more maintainable pattern
7. Refactor and debug by myself when something didn't work as expected

## Reflections
This was more than a code-along project for me which was a space where I developed my problem-solving mindset.
As someone who is self-taught and switching between languages, it was important for me to slow down and build a solid foundation. I now feel ready to take on more advanced topics like: Building projects with frameworks like React, building my own API with JavaScript frameworks like node.js.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 + Sass
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Netlify
